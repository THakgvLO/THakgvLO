# Hi there! I'm Thakgalo 👋

I'm a **problem-solver** at heart, passionate about using **computer science** to tackle **environmental challenges**. With a foundation in **Python**, I'm currently trying to expand my knowledge on the application of it in data analysis and visualization. I'm also looking to expand my skill set by learning **C++ and Java**. My goal is to develop **scalable, accessible, and impactful solutions** that contribute to a better world.

## 🌍 What I'm working on
- Exploring **GIS datasets** to analyze environmental and infrastructural challenges.
- Building **Python-based applications** with an emphasis on **efficiency and usability**.
- Experimenting with **LaserCube** for interactive **GIS mapping and spatial visualizations** (An interest I'm looking to explore anhd discover - got enticed by it).
- Diving deeper into **SQL** to work with large datasets and improve data-driven decision-making (I'm improving day by day).

## 🚀 Skills & Interests
- **Programming Languages**: Python (trying to master and dive deeper into it), other languages include C++ & Java
- **Data Analysis & GIS**: ArcGIS Pro, SQL, spatial data processing
- **Tech & Tools** (Still learning and exploring): DevTools, Google Cloud, Tkinter (for user-friendly interfaces)
- **Optimizing workflows** (Trying to master and explore): Stored procedures, triggers, efficient debugging
- **Creative & Problem-Solving Mindset**: Bringing structured solutions to complex problems

## 🤝 Looking to collaborate!
I’m open to working on projects that combine **GIS, Python, and environmental problem-solving**. If you're tackling **sustainability, infrastructure, or data-driven analysis**, let’s build something meaningful together.
